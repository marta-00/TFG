# Development of algorithms for optimizing GPS measurements in sports competitions 

This project is the Bachelor's Thesis (TFG) for the Physics degree. It consists of analyzing GPS data from various 
types of races (half marathon, cycling race, and high-altitude races) and improving the data using different algorithms 
to achieve greater accuracy in race metrics (total distance, altitude, etc.). (The code, comments and final report are
written in spanish)

## PROGRESS
1. Data Reading: Working with GPX data.
2. Calculation of Metrics and Graphs: Analyzing the data to understand it.
3. Data Cleaning: Removing outlier data.
4. Simulation: A small simulation using only 3 or 4 points to determine which algorithms may work.
5. Algorithm Development.
